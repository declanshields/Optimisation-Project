# Optimisation Project
 
This project was a University module aimed at optimising a supplied program.
To optimise this project, I implemented Memory and Time profilers that track memory allocation and execution time of certain functions.
I also implemented a Quadtree with varying depths, and multithreading.
This project then needed to be ported to Linux, this code is provided to inspect, but will not run on a Windows machine.

The project is currently configured to run with 1000 cubes, a quadtree of depth 3 (or 32 even quadrants) and 16 threads.

Controls:
-To output memory information to the console, press '1'
-To output time information to the console, press '2'
